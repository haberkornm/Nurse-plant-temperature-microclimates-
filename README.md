Analysis of Sonoran Desert nurse plant microclimates  
Ground temperature data has been collected for under canopies of Ambrosia deltoidea, Parkinsonia microphylla, Olneya tesota, Larrea tridentata, and open ground at four different locations within the Sonoran Desert using the Kestral Drop 1 temperature logger.  Data was collected at these locations between the months of December and July over the course of several years.  Temperature data was not collected for each of these plants at each location due to absence of some plants at some locations.
